# Cubifier
Fundamental Data Structures Project consisting on a standalone, 2-D game. All components including game engine were built from scratch.

	**Project Idea & Theme: Cubifier!**
	This class project will serve the idea of building and programming a simple 2D video game using SFML. The game will be based on a “cuboid” placed in a field of square tiles. The player by using the keyboard and specifically the arrows (←, ↑, ↓, →) will be able to move the cuboid by rotating it in three dimensions, and his purpose by doing so will be to place it on the single empty tile of the field. If the cuboid falls out of the range of the tiles which determine the playground the player loses. If the player places the cuboid in the winning position, so in the empty tile, he wins and proceeds to the next level. The game will include approximately 10 levels with different difficulties. Optionally, there might be also a counter to keep track on the moves that the player does, so it can save some scores of different players, and list the top ones
